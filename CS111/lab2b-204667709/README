2B.1A. Explain the variation in time per operation vs the number of iterations?
Cost per op = (thread creation cost + list operations cost) / # of operations.
With small amount of iterations the cost of creating threads overwhelm the cost
of list operations. So the cost per operation will be high with small number of
iterations. However, when the list operation cost is close to the thread
creation cost, the cost per operation will reach the smallest. In constrast,
with high number of operations the cost per operation will go up again because
the list operation cost overwhelm the thread creation cost.

2B.1B. How would you propose to correct for this effect?
One correction would be to graph (average cost per operation / number of elements) vs the number of operations.

2B.2A. Compare the variation in time per protected operation vs the number of threads in Project 2B and in Project 2A.  Explain the difference.
1.list critical section is larger than the critical section of the add function
2.Lock is held much larger in list.
3.Probility of conflict is much larger for the same number of threads in list.
4.More conflicts means more blocked threads, more overhead, less parallelism.
