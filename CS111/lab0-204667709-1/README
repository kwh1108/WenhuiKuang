This tar ball contains five files

they are the source file of my lab0 which is lab0.c, two screenshots of my debugging by using
gdb with the --segfault argument, and the make file which has the functionality of creating
the executable of my source file, smoke check of my program, making the tar ball of all the
submission files, and clean all the file generated by make.
